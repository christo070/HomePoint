# General Instructions
## Running the application
- The configuration file will be used only if `app.py` is executed by
    ```shell
    python3 run.py
    ```
    not by
    ```shell
    flask run
    ```
    However the latter can be used to run the application if the configuration file is not needed.
- Since `instance_relative_config` is set to True, the configuration file(`config.py`) is expected to be in the instance folder.
- If instance folder does not exist, it will be created during execution. But no configuration file is created in the instance folder.
- The `instance/config.py` will only be used if it exists, otherwise, the default configuration will be used.
- Secret keys and other sensitive information should be stored in the configuration file & should not be committed to the repository.
## User Interface
- Bootstrap is used for the UI design in the form of compiled minified version of CSS and JS. Refer for more info ðŸ‘‰ [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Bootstrap Icons is used as Icon Fonts. Refer for more info ðŸ‘‰ [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
- When experimenting with CSS, it is important to disable CSS caching in the browser.


## Manually creating DB
1. The app will create DB if .db file does not exist in `src/instance` folder and add admin user.
2. If you want to manually create the DB, navigate to instance folder and follow the steps below:
    ```shell
    flask shell
    ```
3. Run the following commands in flask shell:
    ```shell
    from app.models import db
    db.drop_all()
    db.create_all()
    ```
